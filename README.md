# OMNI

What is OMNI? Well, quite frankly it's a NSFW browser extension that will intensify your horny mental state and will put it into overdrive! It will absolutely give you the risk-free orgasm you've been craving, and will NOT actively run while your browser is closed! ( Will NOT save passwords, track data, or steal any personal/private information )

Keep in mind: the following browser extension is intended for ages 18 years or older! This extension will only work on chrome and opera gx. ( Eventually there will be a firefox version released sometime in the near future )
